## SharePoint BCS List Example
This project is an example of creating an external BCS content type in a SharePoint Hosted Add-In, which allows you to apply CRUD (Create, Read, Update and Delete) operations to data outside of SharePoint.

## Project Goal
The goal of this project is to demonstrate how to:
* Create a BCS List in a SharePoint Hosted Add-In
* Demonstrate how to use the Office Fabric UI React Framework
* Separate the User Interface from the SharePoint Hosted Add-In

Please [reference my blog post](http://dattabase.com/sharepoint-app-fabric-ui-react-part-1-3/) for a step-by-step guide on creating a solution using the Office Fabric React Framework.
